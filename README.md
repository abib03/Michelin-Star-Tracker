# Project 1
## Hungry for some Michelin
### Contributed by Alex, Abib, Amy

For our project, we've decided to go outside of the Fintech Industry and examine something that someone not in the tech industry could relate to. 
In out project we reviewed Michelin star restaurants in the San Francisco and New York city areas. 
Our projects is to uncover locations of these restaurants, as well as find them by cuisine, and how many stars they have based on a one through five factor. 
These are the questions we asked and what we found to answer them.
## Questions and Answers
### Which city has the higher concentration of Michlein Starred restaurants? and by which cuisine type?

  To start using our data we collected, we first had to clean it. We used methods we learned in class. 
### What is the cuisine type of each restaurant?

### Visualizations of the varying prices of each reastaurant? Which cuisine type is the most expensive?

### What is the total number of restaurants that have Michelin stars in each city, sorted by each star rating?

### What is the variation between categories? (by price, rating, location)
